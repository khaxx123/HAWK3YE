# HAWK3YE
HAWK3YE is a drone-based system optimizing wind farm site selection. It is used for high-accuracy 3D terrain mapping . A Python pipeline analyzes the terrain to dynamically calculate the Wind Shear Exponent (alpha), predicting wind speed at hub height via the Power Law. This makes surveys 80%faster and 60%cheaper, supporting SDG 7.
